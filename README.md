# theNeedleDrop
A spider that aggregates data from theneedledrop.com, Anthony Fantano's website. The site data was scraped via Python Scrapy and stored into a JSON file. 

# What's in store?
I would like to perform a scrape of Fantano's YouTube channel and merge that dataset with my current one, as there were a lot of missing values from scores in his older reviews that were present in his YouTube reviews. 

# Update
Well I just did an EDA of the dataset and found some neat insights. You should check it out! https://the-needle-drop-data.herokuapp.com
