# theNeedleDrop
A spider that aggregates data from theneedledrop.com, Anthony Fantano's website. This will be a dataset I will later use for exploratory data analysis using Python Anaconda. The site data was scraped via Python Scrapy and stored into a JSON file. 

# What's in store?
I'm hoping to add a MySQL database to store the site data, and get some practice with working with SQL. In addition, I plan to do an exploratory data analysis on Anthony Fantano's album reviews using Anaconda. I have used RMarkdown to do EDA for datasets in undergrad, but I would like to get more practice with using Python.
